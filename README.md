# Modul 242 - Smart Home
If you want to start with "smarthome" this is a perfect way to start modernizing your house. 
This guide will show how to change the colors of a LED strip using a telegramm-bot and a microcontroller.
Since we didn't have a house available, we built a small house out of cardboard as a demo and divided it by different rooms. This way we can simulate the whole thing.

## What can the program do?
- Set light color and mode via Telegram-Bot or Microcontroller for each room
- Set color white, red and blue including blinking and party mode, which is a mix of colors
- Telegram-Bot recognizes key-words such as **sleep** for confortable colors to sleep, **day** for bright colors and **party** for fancy colors

There is also a tutorial on how to use this program. The video is linked to this repository or you can contact the owners of the project (references in the last chapter of this file)
